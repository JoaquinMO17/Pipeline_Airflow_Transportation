# Justification
Public transportation data is socially and economically important because it reveals how mobility infrastructure affects equity, access, and environmental impact across Mexican cities. By analyzing trends in ridership, frequency, and service coverage, governments and operators can identify inefficiencies, underserved communities, and opportunities to improve low-carbon transportation alternatives. This kind of analysis directly strengthens city planning, reduces emissions by optimizing routes, and helps allocate public resources more effectively. Ultimately, communities, city authorities, and environmental agencies benefit from insights that promote fairer mobility, lower congestion, healthier air quality, and more resilient transit systems.

## Why these charts?

- Transport Activity Over Time (Line Chart)
This chart reveals long-term patterns in mobility across Mexico. It supports the justification that transport data has economic and environmental significance by highlighting growth, drops, or seasonality that reflect real-world factors like urban expansion, fuel prices, policy changes, or environmental interventions.

- Transport Modes Comparison (Bar Chart)
Shows which systems (RTP, Metrobús, Qrobús, etc.) carry more activity. This directly supports mobility planning and resource allocation — aligning with the social and economic importance described earlier.

- KPI – Total Transport Activity
A single metric summarizing overall usage, useful for mobility planners and municipal decision-makers to quickly assess system demand.

## How does this dashboard help solve a real-world problem?

This dashboard transforms raw public-transport usage data into accessible insights that city planners, environmental agencies, and policymakers can use for decision-making.

If activity is rising, cities may need more buses, more electric fleets, or expanded routes.

If demand drops in certain years, it might indicate accessibility barriers or service issues.

Understanding which transport modes dominate helps allocate public budgets more efficiently.

Tracking long-term trends contributes to reducing emissions by optimizing route planning and reducing congestion.
